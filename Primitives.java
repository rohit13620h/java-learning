public class Primitives {
    /* primitives datatypes
    primitives datetypes are those types of data that cannot be further divided into other datatypes
    eg int can not be divided any further  but string(rohit,long,cheat) can be divided into char or characters(t,r,h)
    int rollno=27,38;                                   4 bytes
    long largeinteger=148756487968465487498L;           8 bytes
    char letter='r','k';                                1 bytes
    float marks=65.89f;                                 4 bytes     float can also give error it can round up the data in decimal
    double largedecimalnumbers=54878643249874.654546;   8 bytes
    boolean check=true or false;                        1 bit i guess
    we should also make sure the data given should be less then the capacity of datatype
    eg byte can store from -128 to 127 , short(small int) around -32k to32k

    int and double are there we dont need to sprcify that but for long and float at the end capital L and small f
    eg for s= 2*4.44 will give 8.88 which will be double so if we want floar value we do s =2*4.44f
        and similar for long

    these primitive datatypes start with small letter so they are not class but we can create class for these also
    eg Integer rno=99 which will enable for many function to be applied to it (rno)
    rollno. < rno.  after appling dot we can see which funtions can be applied to it when doing so functions for rno. will be more
    wrapper class
